“Hope” is the thing with feathers TEST
That perches in the soul TEST
And sings the tune without the words TEST
And never stops TEST at all TEST

And sweetest TEST in the Gale TEST is heard TEST
And sore must be the storm TEST
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm TEST

I’ve heard it in the chillest land TEST
And on the strangest Sea TEST
Yet TEST never TEST in Extremity,
It asked a crumb TEST of me.
